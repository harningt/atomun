This offers the following benefits:\r\n* Divide responsibility firmly\r\n* Offer more re-usable components without forcing the kitchen sink\r\n* Promote development progress by preventing decision paralysis from stopping _all_ progress by keeping multiple pieces open\r\n\r\nAll projects, unless otherwise noted, are under the [Apache 2.0 license][Apache2.0].\r\n\r\nAlso, all libraries will follow the guidelines set forth in [Semantic Versioning 2.0][SemVer2.0]\r\n\r\n## atomun-mnemonic\r\n\r\nThe [atomun-mnemonic](https://github.com/harningt/atomun-mnemonic) project implements the necessary\r\ndetails to generate mnemonic sequences and turn them into data that can be used to generate\r\nBitcoin keys.
